# Umich-TDX-Refresher

Known Issues:
- Doesn't work with Downloads tab because the code selects by title and the title value is incomplete in downloads.  Need alternate selection
- My Work tab simulated click misses the refresh button because it is located in a different spot than the refresh button on the other pages
- People tab might not want to be refreshed ever
- My Work might not want to be refreshed
- on the hub and both Assets pages, refresh should only occur in desktop view.  other views like ticket aging reports should not be refreshed at a page level
